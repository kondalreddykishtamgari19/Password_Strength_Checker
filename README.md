🔐 Password Strength Evaluator in Python
📄 Project Description:-
This project is a Python function that evaluates the strength of a password entered by the user. It checks for various factors like length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program aims to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

🛠️ Features:-
Evaluates password strength based on:
Length (minimum 8 characters)
Uppercase and lowercase letters
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+ etc.)
Categorizes password strength as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
Provides feedback for improving weak passwords

📁 File Structure
│── password_strength.py
│── README.md
password_strength.py: The main Python script.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x (no additional libraries required)

📄 Example Output
Enter a password to check its strength: Pass@123
Password Strength: Strong
Your password meets all criteria!

Enter a password to check its strength: hello123
Password Strength: Weak
Suggestion: Include uppercase letters and special characters.


🔧 Password Evaluation Criteria
Weak: Less than 8 characters, lacks complexity.
Moderate: At least 8 characters, includes a mix of letters and digits.
Strong: At least 8 characters, includes uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

💡 Future Improvements
Integrate GUI using Tkinter for better user experience.
Store previously checked passwords and their strengths.
Provide a password generator to suggest strong passwords.
